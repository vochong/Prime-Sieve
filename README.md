# Prime-Sieve

Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, this simple python program illustrates 3 properties:
  1)  Linear time complexity (almost, actually nloglogn)

  2)  Comparison to n/logn approximation

  3)  Asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers

The prompts are not designed to handle illogical input, so please be gentle

I began writing this in C++, but I figured that I should start learning python for its graphing libraries.
